# Chapter 9: Building Univariate Time Series Models Using Statistical Methods

## Summary

This chapter focuses on building foundational statistical forecasting models, including exponential smoothing and the ARIMA family of models (ARIMA, SARIMA), along with automated ARIMA approaches.

## Recipes

- Plotting ACF and PACF
- Forecasting univariate time series data with exponential smoothing
- Forecasting univariate time series data with non-seasonal ARIMA
- Forecasting univariate time series data with seasonal ARIMA
