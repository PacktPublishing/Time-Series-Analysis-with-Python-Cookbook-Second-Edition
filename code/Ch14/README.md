# Chapter 14: Advanced Techniques for Complex Time Series

## Summary

This chapter addresses complex time series scenarios involving multiple overlapping seasonal patterns, utilizing advanced decomposition (MSTL) and modeling techniques like UCM, TBATS, and NeuralProphet.

## Recipes

- Understanding state-space models
- Decomposing time series with multiple seasonal patterns using MSTL
- Forecasting with multiple seasonal patterns using the Unobserved Components Model (UCM)
- Forecasting time series with multiple seasonal patterns using AutoTBATS
- Forecasting time series with multiple seasonal patterns using NeuralProphet
